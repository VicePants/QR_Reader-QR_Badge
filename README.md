# QR_Reader-QR_Badge

# this is a movement detection app, like an badge system witch you can use for your door bell camera
# i made it as a school project so don't take it too seriouly
# it needs some manipulations to work proprely:

# First of all create a simple DB with only one table(i called it access) with 2 rows: name and code(or just adjust it in the code)
# so you can have an access code for every member, and you can know hou deactivates the whole thing.
# in the DB you'll need the access cote in text format. The camera scans QRcodes then it converts it into text.
# To create your QRcodes, there are a lot of free services on the internet
# i left an exemple of the DB

# 2 you'll need an email address who sends you messages if there is an movement in front of the camera, or you can turn it off by commenting the function
